                            able to make it, you can cancel your
                            reservation. It’s important to make

                            In this step you can select the bike
                            you actually want to rent. You will
                            see an overview of all the bikes,
                            which are available during the day
                            and time you’ve selected before. If
                            you need help deciding which bike
